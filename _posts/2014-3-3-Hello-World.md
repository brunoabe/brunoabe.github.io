title: Prague 21/08/2019

It all begins with us heading to London Heathrow airport, our flight to Prague was scheduled for 8h50 in the evening and since there is the need for arriving early before flying, we left our place at about 5h00 in the afternoon. We were living in Hammersmith so a 15 minute walk from home to the Hammersmith tube station was our first step to go on our trip. We were carrying Miguel in his pushchair, two hang bags and two backpacks. My parents had two backpacks and two hand bags. The commute to the airport wasn’t bad at all, the tube was not empty, but not too crowded also. It took us about 35 minutes to reach the final destination. We grabbed all our stuff, left the train and entered the airport. Once inside, we had to look for the check-in cabins for British Airways. I have to admit, it was not an easy task. I learned that Heathrow terminals are huge and we had to walk for about 15 minutes to reach the correct room. Once there things got easy, we could even check our hand baggage as checked-in luggage for free, which saved us a lot of efforts on carrying stuff.

That was it, my dad wanted to go to the bathroom as soon as possible, so right after checking in, we went looking for one. We all ended-up using the facilities. We had plenty of time to do all the process of exiting UK borders, but we thought there was no harm in doing it as early as possible. The usual process of having to take all metals, computer off bags, and this time even folding the pushchair to go through the X-ray. Gladly we were able to take with us a couple of water bottles, one of the few advantages of traveling with a baby other than its company. After that, we just had to stay in the main waiting room until the gate was available. I was really hungry and needed to go to the toilet, so Kelly stood with my parents and Miguel sat in a bench while I went doing what I had to do and looking for food. There weren’t many options to be fair, lots of carbohydrates and a very few amount of proteins available.

On the first day we have arrived in Praha airport, it was really late already and we were in four adults and a 2 year old toddler. Since we were staying at the Expo Hotel, nearly 1 hour trip using the public transport, we decided that it would be too much and we needed an alternative, specially because our son was already as sleep and we wanted to start the tourism early in the morning next day.

We hired a service van for 1000 Kr, which was at the moment about 50 euros. The driver picked us up inside the airport and accompanied us to the van, where he helped us loading the 4 hand bags, two backpacks and the baby pushchair.

The way to the hotel was very nice, it was very calm, no transit at all and the driver took the opportunity to show us Prague castle from far away and tell us a little about the region, as well as expected commute times from the hotel to the main tourist attractions.

When we arrived at the hotel, the weather was very comforting, not too warm, not too cold, we took our luggage and went straight to the balcony for checking in. The process was really easy and soon enough we went to our rooms, both in the same floor.

We took a shower and went straight to bed to have our first night of sleep at the foreign country. It was very good, the bed was really comfortable and we could enjoy the rest. One thing to notice though, was the lack of water in the room and, because of the time, even the reception was closed.
